## Lessons Learned in Ep01

This project will help us to understand how autherisation works.
Here I have used Node.js to learn the concept.

And It follows MVC architecure.

- **Models**: Contains the user model where user data is stored.
- **Controllers**: Contains the logic for registration and login.
- **Routes**: Defines the endpoints for authentication and protected routes.
- **Middleware**: Contains the JWT authentication middleware.
- **Config**: Typically for database configuration, though not used in this simplified example.
- **Server**: Sets up the Express server and uses the authentication routes.

## Running Tests

```bash
  node start
