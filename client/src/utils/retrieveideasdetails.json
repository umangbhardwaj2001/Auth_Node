    "description": "To test Fiber orders, we need ports and the ports in QA environment are pretty limited. In order to check which accounts are occupying ports, we go through the following steps:\n1. Check Netwin portal for Accounts occupying ports in a specific environment or check for Ports currently reserved and pending activation.\n2. If pending ports are found, query the database with the pending Reservation ID and get the Account Number. - [Database keeps timing out]\n3. Check the Account in DDP to get the Account's owner and its history (When the account was last used). - [This step is slow]\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all accounts.\nIn order to get this data all in one place instead of switching between different applications, I created this tool which saves the hassle and provides all the data in a tabular format in just a few clicks.",
